# Introduction to CNN's based on Bee classification

Goal of the project is to present the problem of multidimensional image classification. 
Step by step we introduce the reader to the topics of convolutional neural networks.

The interactive form of the notebook enables us to produce better educational resource.
We've carefully chosen the example, so that it can be generalised into set of similar problems.
The document that you'll find here therefore can be useful when starting a new CNN project.

## General key points:
- **Theoretical introduction**
	- Basic concepts
	- What are CNN's?
	- Structure of neural networks
- **Example based on bee classification**
	- Dataset
	- Data refinement
	- Metrics for multidimensional parameters
	- The model
	- Problem of overfitting
	- Experiment with single color channel
	- Final results
