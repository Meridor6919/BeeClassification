Introduction
===============
Bee classification is a team project focused on learning CNN's.
The idea of this initiative is to correctly classify images in four distinct categories:
- do we see a bee or a wasp
- does the bee carry pollen-packets
- is the bee infected by varoa-mite
- does the bee cool the hive by flappingn it's wings

We are testing different architectures and optimizations focused on:
===============
1. increasing the precision of predictions
2. improving time needed for learning
3. expanding explainability of our model

In more detail our work addresses the following key points:
===============
- Developing better model architecture
- Refining data
- Applying pooling or/and image compression
- Reducing number of color channels
- Visualizing weights
- Creating comprehensive documentation

Technical information
===============
Project is developed in TensorFlow Keras
Database we are using is tensorflow's bee_dataset
Our working enviroment is GoogleColab
